Invite the SF Surfrider Foundation to create art with your students using clean plastic collected at beach cleanups while learning about the big impact they can have by making small changes to avoid single use plastic. You also have the options of using plastic collected at school or having students collect it themselves at a beach cleanup (find this as a separate activity under Field Trips). Student art may also be included in the Surfrider Foundation's annual art show, "Message in a Bottle". Email Eva at RAP@sf.surfrider.org with the subject line "Marine Plastic Classroom Presentation for (Your School): Earth Day Every Day" to schedule.
