Take your students to visit Ocean Beach or Baker Beach for a 1-2 hour cleanup and collect data on the plastics you find. To schedule, email Eva at RAP@sf.surfrider.org with the subject line "Beach Cleanup for (Your School), Earth Day Every Day".

​

Optionally, take it full circle by reusing the (cleaned) plastics your students find to create ocean pollution-inspired art with SF Surfrider Foundation volunteers back in your classroom. Art pieces may be included in the Surfrider Foundation's annual gallery show, "Message in a Bottle". Find this as a separate activity under Classroom Presentations.
