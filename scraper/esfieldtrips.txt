What form does carbon take as it cycles around the planet? Students explore how plants grow and what happens to their matter when the plants die. They create microscope slides to investigate how plants take up CO2, gather observations of plant structures, and construct explanations for how air flows through the leaf. Students then use media-rich visualizations, role-playing, and fossil fuel specimens to bolster evidence for how plants affect the amount of CO2 in the air. Tuesdays, September to May.
