 10 points per event

A walking school bus is a parent/caregiver‐initiated group of children walking to school with one or more adults. It can be as simple and informal as several families taking turns walking their children to school, or as structured as a route with meeting points, a timetable and a regularly rotated schedule of volunteers. Read a quick guide for Walking School Buses or contact Jacquie Zapata-Chavez at gogreen@sfusd.edu for onsite support getting the first one started. Please put "Walking School Bus Support for (Your School Name): Earth Day Every Day" in the subject line.
